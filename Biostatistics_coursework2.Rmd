## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(mlmRev)
library(lme4)
library(rstanarm)
library(ggplot2)

```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Some data wrangling. Changing the date format to represent only year and momth
```{r}
rownames(bike_data) = bike_data$Date
bike_data$Date <- as.Date(bike_data$Date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
bike_data$Date <- format(bike_data$Date, "%Y-%m")

```

Plot the distribution of the bike data
Volume = number of bikes in a day
Rain is the depth of rainfall per day
Temperature is the temperature that day
```{r}
plot(bike_data)
```

Remove any missing data
```{r}
bike_data <- bike_data[complete.cases(bike_data),]

```

Fitting the model using lmer and no predictor
````{r}

##Varying intercept model with one predictor "Temperature"
````{r}
Model2 <- lmer(formula = Volume ~ 1 + Temp + (1 | Date),
               data = bike_data,

summary(Model2)
````
The average regression line across the years is estimated as   μ^ij=1938.92+99.71xij, with σα and σy estimated as 1344 and 1443 respectively. 
These date specific regression lines are based on partial pooling estimates

Extract random effects from the Date. This estimates how the intercept is shifted up or down on particular months of the year.For instance in November 2016, (2016_11), the intercept is about 668 times higher than average

Evaluating model convergance
````{r}
plot(Model1_Stan, "rhat")
````
The R^ is essentially the ratio of between-chain variance to within-chain variance analogous to ANOVA. The R^ statistic should be less than 1.1 if the chains have converged.
